# UFO_weighted_analysis_Strat

The initial sample designs from the NOC may not include weights of plots broken down into special management areas. For examples, Wilderness areas, which have higher land health objectives than other BLM land. We recalculate the initial weights from these types of oversights in the initial design, and calculcate the weights of plots after sampling a panel has been completed.
